To underline text, you can use the `u` tag. 
This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. 
With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: underline;` to the element.


Wrap the u tag only around the text "Ph.D. students".

### Note
Try to avoid using the u tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.

<p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</p>
