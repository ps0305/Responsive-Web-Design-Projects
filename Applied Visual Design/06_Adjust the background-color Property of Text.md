Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, 
you can add a background-color to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. 
This challenge uses `rgba()` instead of `hex` codes or normal `rgb()`.
```
rgba stands for:
  r = red
  g = green
  b = blue
  a = alpha/level of opacity
```
The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, 
which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. rgba() is great to use in this case, 
as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out the background.

You'll use `background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1)` for this challenge. 
It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.


To make the text stand out more, adjust the background-color of the h4 element to the given rgba() value.

Also for the `h4`, remove the height property and add `padding` of `10px`.

```js
h4 {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: rgba(45,45,45,0.1)
   }
